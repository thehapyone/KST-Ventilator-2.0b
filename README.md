## Development Environment
The software development environment is based on two platforms - 
 - Visual Studio Code using the Platform.io extension
 - Arduino IDE

 Athough, the codes are developed in Visual studio, a full compatible arduino code is also generated. Moroever, the cpp files from Visual studio can directly by used in Arduino by just changing the main.cpp to main.ino and including all the dependencies in the root folder.

## Display Design 
The graphics used for the display was designed with the Canva (A free online design platform). The live deisgn document is available here
